# robot-street-signs
ROS Package which enables a Neato to recognize and obey simple street signs.

## System
Describe how your system works.  Make sure to include the basic components and algorithms that comprise your project.

### Stage 1

## Design
Describe a design decision you had to make when working on your project and what you ultimately did (and why)? These design decisions could be particular choices for how you implemented some part of an algorithm or perhaps a decision regarding which of two external packages to use in your project.

## Structure
How did you structure your code?

## Challenges
What if any challenges did you face along the way?

## Improvements
What would you do to improve your project if you had more time?

## Lessons
Did you learn any interesting lessons for future robotic programming projects? These could relate to working on robotics projects in teams, working on more open-ended (and longer term) problems, or any other relevant topic.
